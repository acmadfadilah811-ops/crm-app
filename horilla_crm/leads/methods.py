    Convert a Lead into an Account, a Contact, and an Opportunity, linked via
    ContactAccountRelationship and OpportunityContactRole - the same "create
    new" path LeadConversionView.form_valid() runs for the manual Convert
    button, extracted here so other callers (e.g. the WhatsApp bot's
    is_convert signal) can reuse it instead of duplicating the logic.

    Always creates new Account/Contact/Opportunity records (the "select
    existing" paths are form-driven UI choices with no equivalent input in a
    non-form caller). Any name argument left blank falls back to a value
    derived from the lead itself. Runs atomically so a failure partway
    through (e.g. no OpportunityStage configured) doesn't leave an orphaned
    Account/Contact behind.

    Returns (account, contact, opportunity).
